[abstract]
--
Space for replication packages as part of the seminar paper submission.
--


You may use this repo already during writing your seminar paper, but as part of handing in your finished paper it should contain at least

* the LaTeX sources to build the PDF of the document,
** We recommend that you set up a CI task for GitLab that builds your PDF every time you push commits.  We recommend to use the Docker image from the link:{link-island-of-tex}[Island of TeX] project, which provides a very recent version of TeX Live.
* scripts and information about how to replicate your experiments.

[TIP]
--
We have compiled a list of link:{link-presentation-guidelines}[recommendations for preparing your thesis presentation].
Read them carefully before preparing your presentation and follow them.

== Experiment Replication Package

Please add the necessary scripts to make your experiments repeatable.
The supporting documentation should at least answer the following questions:

* Which Python/Java/‚Ä¶ package versions are needed?
* Which other repositories are needed?
    Which subdirectories should they be checked out in?
** There is no need to copy files from other chair or publicly available projects into this repository.
    Instead, please refer to concrete branches/commits/releases that should be checked out.
+
[TIP]
--
You can use the link:{link-git-submodules}[Git submodule] feature to automate parts of that setup.
--

* Which dataset did you use?
    Where should it be placed when running the script?
+
[IMPORTANT]
--
Please do not push large (ùí™(GiB)) datasets to this repository.
Ask your supervisor where the data can be stored instead.
--
* Which commands have to be run to re-create the experiment?
* Where can I find the different results of the experiments?
    What do the resulting files contain?

[TIP]
--
For smaller binary files (e.g., figures) you can use link:{link-git-lfs}[Git LFS] to speed up cloning the repo.
