This project generates the most suitable hyperparameters for GenProg algorithm in Whisker program repair. 

There are two different modes of generation:
1. **Integer mode.** Generates the population size and elitism size.

2. **Float mode.** Generates the probability of mutation and crossover. Headless execution of the program repair: genetation of mutation rate and crossover rate. Full execution of the program repair: genenation of mutation insertion rate, mutation change rate, mutation deletion rate, crossover rate.

The script chooses the best hyperparameters depending on the quality of the solution (its fitness value) and execution time.

External libraries used in the project are presented in **requirements.txt** file:

    pandas~=2.1.1
    numpy~=1.26.0
    scipy~=1.11.3
    joblib~=1.2.0
    tabulate~=0.9.0

To install all Python requirements:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


The following settings can be configured in the config.json file:
```
is_float: A boolean indicating whether float numbers are used in the algorithm. If set to True, the algorithm operates with rational numbers; otherwise, it operates with integers.

mode: Specifies the mode of the algorithm to run. It can be either "rs" for Random Search or "de" for Differential Evolution.

acceleration_factor: This parameter affects the speed of the tests execution.

path_to_repair: The file path to the repair subject (.sb3). 

path_to_test: The file path to the tests (.js).

path_to_output: The file path to save the output results generated by the algorithm (folder).

path_to_csv: The file path where the the output results in CSV format will be saved.

path_to_config: The file path to the configuration file (config.json) that contains the GenProg algorithm settings.

whisker_path: The file path to the Whicker project.

max_iter: Specifies the maximum number of iterations allowed for the algorithm to run before termination. This parameter affects the convergence and runtime of the algorithm.

desired_fitness: Specifies the desired fitness value that the algorithm aims to achieve. The algorithm terminates when it reaches or exceeds this fitness value.
```


To run the algorithm, execute the following command:
    
        python main.py

After the algorithm finishes its work, the results can be viewed in the following files:
1. **RS_all_results.txt** and **RS_all_results.csv** - contains all the results of the Random Search algorithm.
2. **DE_all_results.txt** and **DE_all_results.csv** - contains all the results of the Differential Evolution algorithm.
